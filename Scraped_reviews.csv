Aesthetics,Try hardening the container like glacier  dispenser water
Aesthetics,To be delivered with caution....my bottle looks like someone strangled it...it gat depressions and bruises
Price,I ordered 7 pc 18. 5 litres of aquamist water. For each bottle I was charged 100 shillings per bottle for delivery total 700. Yet the delivery was done once for 7 pc of bottles. I don't understand how this works.

Quality,"So wet, so clear. Water as it should be."
Quality,ORIGINAL BOTTLES WERE COMING WITH BLUE CAP WHICH WAS VERY GOOD QUALITY. THE NEW CAP BLACK IN COLOR IS VERY HARD AND BREAKS THE WATER DISPENSER. UNLESS THEY DON'T CHANGE TO THE ORIGINAL I WOULD NOT BUY BECAUSE TO REPAIR THE DISPENSER IS VERY COSTLY. IT IS STUPID AND POUND FOOLISH TO SAVE A FEW COINS THEY USE SUNSTANDARD MATERIAL.
Quality,Very nice

Quality,The water is very nice. The problem is delivery. They don't package it well most of the time and it arrives with seal broken or dusty/ muddy bottle. I think they let it keep rolling in the dusty back of their vans. I stopped ordering but if you package better I will definitely order again.
